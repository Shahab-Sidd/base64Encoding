            How Encoding Works
        </h1>
        <p style="text-align: center">
            Here's a quote snippet from Thomas Hobbes's Leviathan:
            <br>

"Man is distinguished, not only by his reason, but ..."
<br>

This is represented as an ASCII byte sequence and encoded in MIME's Base64 scheme as follows:
<br>
<br>
TWFuIGlzIGRpc3Rpbmd1aXNoZWQsIG5vdCBvbmx5IGJ5IGhpcyByZWFzb24sIGJ1dCAuLi4=
<br>
<br>
In the above quote the encoded value of Man is TWFu. <br>Encoded in ASCII, the letters "M", "a", and "n" are stored as the bytes 77, 97, 110, which are equivalent to "01001101", "01100001", and "01101110" in base-2. <br>These three bytes are joined together in a 24 bit buffer producing the binary sequence "010011010110000101101110". <br>Packs of 6 bits (6 bits have a maximum of 64 different binary values) are converted into 4 numbers (24 = 4 * 6 bits) which are then converted to their corresponding values in Base64.
